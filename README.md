# Modul 3
The following functions are implemented in this module: 
- calculation of the number of days between a given date and the current date 
- generates a set of unique random numbers within the specified parameters  
- normalizes phone numbers to a standard format 

## Task

1. The get_days_from_today(date) function has been created, which calculates the number of days between a given date and the current date.
2. To win the grand prize of a lottery, you need to match several numbers on the lottery ticket with the numbers drawn randomly and within a certain range during the next draw. For example, you need to guess six numbers from 1 to 49 or five numbers from 1 to 36, etc.
3. Your company is running an active marketing campaign using SMS. To do this, you collect customer phone numbers from your database, but you often find that the numbers are recorded in different formats. Your SMS service can only send messages efficiently if the phone numbers are presented in the correct format. That is why you need a feature that automatically normalizes phone numbers to the correct format by removing all unnecessary characters.
